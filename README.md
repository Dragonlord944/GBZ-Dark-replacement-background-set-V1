# GBZ-Dark-replacement-background-set-V1
Images to replace the backgrounds of GBZ35 Dark theme on small screen devices like the exprimental pi DMG
or similar handheld systems with small screens. Full instructions in the rar file. 
Set one was my initial set and was more a test set with minimal systems support.
V2 was the updated set with numerous small changes and additional systems added.  V3 was a full replacement set that covers everything v1 and 2 did plus considerably more.
V3 brought Extra systems support added to GBZ dark theme along with Menu logos. Over 50 system backgrounds along with alternates for country specific console names (genesis/megadrive etc).
It is worth noting, this set (and the regular non dark set) was created to use with the gbz themes, but they work equally well in any number of others. There is no reason you can't mix things up a little.
Version 4 now complete and uploaded. Contains all the files of set 3 plus a few more machines added to the menu along with new menu Logos.
Additional files in this Git (not required) are a single background image to show the style, plus one image showing a large number of the systems covered using actual background images without dates shown in one large compilation image.
Main files are only available on 'odd months' Jan/Mar/May etc
