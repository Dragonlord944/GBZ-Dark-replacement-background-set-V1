# GBZ-Dark-replacement-background-set-V1
Images to replace the backgrounds of GBZ35 Dark theme on small screen devices like the exprimental pi DMG p
or similar handheld systems with small screens.
Set one is my initial set and was more a test set with minimal systems support.
V2 was the updated set with numerous small changes and additional systems added.  V3 is a full replacement set that covers everything v1 and 2 did plus considerably more.
V3 details. Extra systems support added to GBZ dark theme along with Menu logos. Over 50 system backgrounds along with alternates for country specific console names (genesis/megadrive etc).
It is worth noting, this set (and the regular non dark set) was created to use with the gbz themes, but they work equally well in any number of others. There is no reason you can't mix things up a little.
